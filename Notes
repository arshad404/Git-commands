This text editor contain all the commands that are needed to learn git.

1. Create a repository on github and attach a readme file which contains the information about the project.

2. Then clone the repository on your local desktop and do changes as you want.

3. To check the changes in the repository, check the changes by using command: - git status

4. After changes, to push the updated code you need to follow few steps: 
	
	- git add . (To add all the file that you changed, after using the command your code is still on your computer, you code is in staging area) 

	- git add `file_name` (To add the only file that you want to add)

	- git commit -m "message regarding this commit" (code is still on your computer, but in the version database)

	- git push (Now your code has been pushed on the cloud and you can see the changes on your github profile)
